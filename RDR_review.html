	<h2>Review:</h2>
	<h2><em><u>Francis Lemaire:</u></em></h2>
	<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has one of the best storylines out of all the story games I have played.</p>
	<p>The graphics and soundtrack help create a spectacular immersion for me when venturing.</p>
	<p>The details in this game also contribute to this, as small as the variety in animals to the snow falling off trees.</p>
	<p>While impressive, there was small issues that made the play-through feel slow or confusing.</p>
	<p>I would frequently avoid side missions due to not wanting to wait any longer between main quests. I had a slow start (first time on PS4) having to play many hours before learning all the complicated controls.</p>
	<p>Since I did not play the first Red Dead Redemption it was quite confusing at first trying to put names to faces. </p>
	<p>The online game was not as expected. I believe I speak on the whole community when I say that it was disappointing. It came down to three different factors:</p>
	<li>an unplayable number of glitches.</li>
	<li>poor reward system.</li>
	<li>and a lack of communication from the developers.</li>
