				<h1>Last week's review - It Takes Two</h1>
<h2> General Info:</h2>
	<p>It Takes Two is a two-player split screen game that came out in 2021. You NEED 2 players in order to play but only ONE person needs to buy it. You and the other player play as married couple (May and Cody) on the verge of divorcing. But the characters magically turned into clay and wood dolls and need to find a way to become a human again. It Takes Two is available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox one, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

	<h2>Review:</h2>
	<h2><em><u>Francis Lemaire:</u></em></h2>
	<p>It Takes Two is a brilliant game if you want a fun way to spend your weekend with your kid, friend or partner.</p>
	<p>Each stage would always contain a new feature or item to keep the gameplay fresh.</p>
	<p>Me and my friend took no time before we had a hang of the controls (Keyboard & mouse) </p>
	<p>The characters and graphics are very cute, and the game felt very polished.</p>
	<p>I only had a few issues with the game. The storyline felt quite shallow and predictable, aimed at a much younger audience. I felt no emotional investment for either character. This was due to the small amount of very forced personality traits.</p>
	<p>A small portion of the community stated that some boss fights / puzzles were too hard. Neither me nor my friend experienced this.</p>
